# Program # 1

## Course: 
Cosc 4730

## Name: 
Will Brant

## Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 11)
- Download the app, launch it, tap the textbox to enter your name, enter your name, hit submit
- I'm not quite sure where to find it in the settings, but a quick google search tells me that a moto g power 2021 has a resolution of 720x1600 pixels, 20:9 ratio
- Android version 11

## Anything that doesn't work:
One time the 'hint' in the textbox didn't go away and made it difficult to read user input. After recompiling, the problem went away. Something to look out for.
